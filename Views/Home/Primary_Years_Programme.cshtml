            The Primary Years Programme (PYP) offers a transdisciplinary, inquiry-based, and student-
            centered education with responsible action at its core, enabling students to learn between,
            across and beyond traditional subject boundaries. It guides us to achieve authentic conceptual
            inquiry-based learning that is engaging, significant, challenging and relevant for PYP students. It
            promotes an international perspective, which recognizes and welcomes the diversity of student
            experiences and backgrounds. The Homeroom Facilitator teaches the core curriculum while
            specialist teachers teach art, music, languages, library and physical education. Information
            Communication Technology is integrated into all aspects of the curriculum.

                        framework—the learner, learning and teaching, and the learning community.
                        The learner: describes the outcomes for individual students and the outcomes they seek for
                        themselves (what is learning?)
                        Learning and teaching: articulates the distinctive features of learning and teaching (how best to
                        support learners?)
                        The learning community: emphasizes the importance of the social outcomes of learning and the
                        role that IB communities play in achieving these outcomes (who facilitates learning and
                        teaching?)

                        with the IB educational philosophy and values. The PYP is a framework for schools and their
                        approach to learning and teaching. Students explore significant concepts through units of

                        An inquiry-based approach is used in the teaching methods, which is built upon individual
                        understandings, knowledge, and interests, emphasizing how to learn and how to delve deeper,
                        while developing critical thinking skills. The units of inquiry make up the programme of inquiry
                        and are developed under the IB Transdisciplinary themes, making learning for understanding
                        more effective. Each unit of inquiry allows the students to explore key concepts such as:
                        Form: What is it like?
                        Function: How does it work? Etc.

                    <p>
                        Concepts are that children inquire into, to ensure that they understand what they are learning.
                        Concepts such as change, migration and survival drive the units of inquiry, while concepts such
                        as motion, rhythm and pattern drive a single subject.

                        Agency and self-efficacy are fundamental to learning in the PYP. Learners are given
                        opportunities to create their own contexts based on their prior learning and experiences and the
                        current learning requirements. Throughout the programme, the learner is an agent for their own
                        and others&#39; learning.

                        Action, the core of student agency, is integral to the PYP learning process and to the
                        programme’s overarching outcome of international mindedness. Through taking individual and
                        collective action, students come to understand the responsibilities associated with being
                        internationally minded and to appreciate the benefits of working with others for a shared
                        purpose.
