It establishes the foundation for any dance styles that are appropriate for the dancer's body and temperament. Then there are those who choose to become professional ballet dancers and then specialise in senior levels of the same. Early on, emphasis is placed on arm carriage, use of shoulders, neck, and pulls upwards in the torso, development of musicality, coordination, and simple clean movement in one position on stage. Intermediate lessons concentrate on strengthening the legs and back in preparation for larger and more complex movements that are no longer static but move across the floor/stage. At this stage, small jumps and turns are introduced. Acrobatic elements are introduced gradually. Advanced lessons include mastery of these movements as well as a complete finishing of the dancer in order to adequately express the classical virtuoso.

The main purpose of this club is to teach IB diploma school students about international issues and allow them to develop their own skills of public speaking, researching, writing, and critical thinking and negotiating among many others. It is an extra-curricular activity in which students typically role-play delegates to the United Nations and simulate UN committees. Students, referred to as delegates, are assigned a country to represent in one of the UN's numerous committees with pre-set topics to debate. They research the background of their country, their country's position on the topics at hand, and prepare notes on possible solutions to the problems faced. Chosen students then convene at model UN conferences to debate their assigned topics with students representing the other UN members. Much like the real UN, the goal is to identify solutions, by negotiation and consensus, on which many countries can agree.

Aside from programming logic, children learn to problem solve, collaborate, troubleshoot, think creatively, and persevere. In addition, the children will be taught how to use Scratchjr, an application that allows them to animate and create stories and games. The learning outcome at the end of the semester is the ability to use Scratchjr effectively and to understand loops, events, and decisions in coding.

                        Basketball is a fast-paced sport that requires a lot of running, jumping, dribbling, passing, and shooting. As a result, it provides complete physical exercise, improves accuracy and precision, instills self-discipline, and teaches strategy and quick thinking. It also promotes teamwork and aids in the formation of new friendships. Shiba Maggon (former women's team captain and current junior team coach of India) and technical expert, Capt. Louis George (former Maharashtra state U13 team coach, basketball federation of India 'A' panel referee, FIBA level 3 certified coach) are instrumental in updating the curriculum and up skilling the coaches on a regular basis. Students who receive basic coaching will become more active and fit in the long run, and will prefer physical activities to digital games.

Practicality is prioritised, and it is ensured that in each class, experiments are taught using a hands-on approach, rather than simply being visually shown (on a screen) or orally explained. Experiments are linked to real-life and everyday examples and occurrences. At the end of the semester, the students are given a folder containing classwork papers that include information such as a material list, concepts learned, fun facts, how the project works, and a questionnaire.

                    (Mun) is an academic simulation of the United Nations that aims to educate learners about current events, topics in international relations, diplomacy, and the United Nations agenda. The main purpose of this club is to teach IB diploma school students about international issues and allow them to develop their own skills of public speaking, researching, writing, and critical thinking and negotiating among many others. It is an extra-curricular activity in which students typically role-play delegates to the United Nations and simulate UN committees. Students, referred to as delegates, are assigned a country to represent in one of the UN's numerous committees with pre-set topics to debate. They research the background of their country, their country's position on the topics at hand, and prepare notes on possible solutions to the problems faced. Chosen students then convene at model UN conferences to debate their assigned topics with students representing the other UN members. Much like the real UN, the goal is to identify solutions, by negotiation and consensus, on which many countries can agree.

                     We are a coding club. Using drag and drop, children will learn the logic of programming. The advantages of coding are numerous. Aside from programming logic, children learn to problem solve, collaborate, troubleshoot, think creatively, and persevere. In addition, the children will be taught how to use Scratchjr, an application that allows them to animate and create stories and games. The learning outcome at the end of the semester is the ability to use Scratchjr effectively and to understand loops, events, and decisions in coding.

                    Basketball is a fast-paced sport that requires a lot of running, jumping, dribbling, passing, and shooting. As a result, it provides complete physical exercise, improves accuracy and precision, instills self-discipline, and teaches strategy and quick thinking. It also promotes teamwork and aids in the formation of new friendships. Shiba Maggon (former women's team captain and current junior team coach of India) and technical expert, Capt. Louis George (former Maharashtra state U13 team coach, basketball federation of India 'A' panel referee, FIBA level 3 certified coach) are instrumental in updating the curriculum and up skilling the coaches on a regular basis. Students who receive basic coaching will become more active and fit in the long run, and will prefer physical activities to digital games.
