                        Siblings of current students of Primary Years Programme, Early Years Programme, Middle Years Programme, and IB Diploma Programme move to the top of their respective categories as a result of our commitment to keeping families together in a single school.

                    Diversity on campus is beneficial for all the students. This helps our learners to meet new people and
                    gain an understanding of their viewpoints. MLSI is an equal and fair opportunity school that
                    welcomes all students irrespective of their identity, citizenship, origin, abilities or beliefs. The
                    school&#39;s teaching and learning method is guided by the principles of differentiation and inclusion.
                    Learning at school with everyone helps our students learn more about themselves. It makes them
                    open-minded and willing to compromise and know how to work together calmly.
