                The IB PYP curriculum is taught by the class teacher, while specialist teachers teach art, music, languages, the library, and physical education. All aspects of the curriculum incorporate information and communication technology.

                    In the teaching methods, an inquiry-based approach is used, which is built on individual understandings, knowledge, and interests, emphasising how to learn and how to delve deeper, while developing critical thinking skills. The units of inquiry comprise the programme of inquiry and are developed in accordance with the IB Transdisciplinary themes, resulting in more effective learning for understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each unit of inquiry enables students to investigate key concepts such as:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong class="black">Form:</strong> What is it like?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong class="black">Function:</strong> How does it work?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong class="black">Reflection:</strong> How do we know?
                </p>
                <p class="m-0">
                    Concepts are broad ideas that children explore to ensure they comprehend what they are learning. Units of inquiry are driven by concepts such as change, migration, and survival, whereas single topics are driven by concepts such as motion, rhythm, and pattern.

                    The IB PYP programme offers students the opportunity to take an active role in their learning. It is based on five essential elements:
                </p>
                <ul class="checklist mb-4">
                    <li>Concepts </li>
                    <li>Skills   </li>
                    <li>Knowledge</li>
                    <li>Attitudes</li>
                    <li>Action   </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In addition, the PYP teaching strategies emphasises the importance of knowledge. Students will learn about the mentioned topics as well as individual subjects like Mathematics, English, Art, Physical Education, and Languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The  International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme also requires the creation of transdisciplinary themes that go beyond individual subject areas. These include thinking, communication, social, research, and self-management abilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, the programme seeks to instil positive attitudes such as appreciation, commitment, confidence, cooperation, creativity, curiosity, empathy, enthusiasm, independence, integrity, respect, and tolerance.
                </p>
                <p class="m-0">
                    Students are urged to put what they've learned into action, not just in their school community, but also in the larger world. Effective action is voluntary and requires students taking initiative and taking on responsibilities.
