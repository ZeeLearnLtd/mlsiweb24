                            The IB focuses on  skill development rather than memorizing facts and rote learning which enables students to question their own inquiry and reflect on the same. The goal of 'inquiry-based learning' is to educate students how to structure their own learning.
                        </p>
                        For example, a typical CBSE test question might be, "How long did it take Ashoka to build his pillars?" But an IB teacher might ask, "What effect did Ashoka's pillars have on his people?"

                            MLSI is an IB affiliated school in India which employs multiple assessment strategies to assess students' learning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Formative assessment or assessment for learning are generally conducted in an informal way by asking questions in class, checking students' work in class, or simply conversing with the student in the canteen. Feedback is then given to the students so that they could incorporate the same in their exams which is known as the summative assessment.
                        </p>
                        Summative assessments, or assessment of learning checks students' ability to comprehend at the end of a unit, are also conducted in a variety of ways. There could be a presentation, a role-playing exercise, a movie, or a report. Catering to different learning needs, opportunities are given to the students  to make their learning visible in a variety of ways.
