                            India has always been a land of knowledge and learning. Centres like Takshila and Nalanda were much ahead of their times and bigger than Harvard and Oxford. When the world didn’t know about civilization, we were imparting value-based education through the Guru-shishya parampara. According to a report by William Adam, a Britisher, in 1840 there were approximately 1 lakh schools in Bengal and Bihar alone.

                        <p>
                            Today, the glory has perhaps waned a little bit.

                        <p>
                            As we stand on the threshold of a world without borders, it becomes important for us to bring the old glory back. And to integrate our knowledge with an international outlook. Simply because, a global education creates more enlightened citizens. Mount Litera School International, a flagship international school, has been making a valuable contribution towards creating citizens of the future.

                        <p>
                            Mount Litera School International’s holistic approach to academics has earned the trust of our esteemed parents. The international curriculum is further enriched by our cultural ethos. Which makes us as one of the few schools that is truly international, and yet, has deep-rooted Indian values.
