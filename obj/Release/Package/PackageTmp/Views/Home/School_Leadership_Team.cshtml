                            Let me begin by congratulating each one of you for choosing MLSI as a school for your child.
                            It is with great pride and excitement that I share this introduction to you as the Head of School of MLSI. I am honoured to have the opportunity to lead a school with such a rich tradition of education!

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have been dedicated to the field of education for more than 24 years.
                            As an educator I am very passionate about IB education and have a rich experience of working with the IB in many roles.
                            I look forward to partnering with you to provide our students with a rigorous, engaging, and high-quality school experience. Parents are every child’s first teacher and I believe that by working together, we can make sure your child’s social, emotional, and academic needs are met.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I will be working closely with the Management and the staff to guarantee that all of our students are intellectually challenged. Our main aim is to create global citizens who will become leaders for tommorow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As your Head of School, it is important to me that everyone who steps through our doors-teachers, students, and parents-are excited to be here! This attitude enables us to meet the challenges of academic excellence in a positive, fun, and nurturing environment. My door is always open and I welcome your input throughout the school year. Please feel free to call or email me to discuss any concerns, or ideas you would like to share; our continued success is dependent on your feedback.
                            I look forward to working with you as a team to help each student at MLSI meet their goals and become successful learners.

                        </p>
