                    The IB Diploma Programme (DP) is a two-year academically challenging and structured course that covers basic disciplines such as languages, arts, science, and math, as well as the option for increased emphasis in selected IB Diploma subjects.

                    The IB Diploma Programme curriculum consists of six subject groups and a core made up of three distinct parts, as shown in the curriculum model below:

                <p>
                    Students are expected to take three 'Higher Level' (HL) and 'Standard Level' (SL).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The three mandatory core components that contribute to a student's educational experience and challenge them to apply their knowledge and understanding are as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Extended Essay: The extended essay is a serious piece of academic research and writing in which students independently research and investigate an interesting topic to produce a 4000-word in-depth study.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Theory of knowledge (TOK): It allows students to reflect on the nature of knowledge by critically examining how we know in various ways and areas of knowledge. Students who become aware of their own perspectives are better able to act responsibly in an increasingly interconnected world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creativity, Action, and Service: CAS engages students in a variety of activities (such as community service, sports, and creative pursuits) in addition to their academic studies, fostering an appreciation of life outside the classroom walls.
