            The MYP aims to develop active learners and internationally minded young people who can empathize
            with others and pursue lives of purpose and meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
            The programme empowers students to inquire into a wide range of issues and ideas of significance
            locally, nationally and globally. The result is young people who are creative, critical, and reflective
            thinkers.

                <p>
                    The MYP was revised in September 2014 to provide a more rigorous and highly flexible framework that
                    powerfully integrates with local educational requirements. New industry-leading onscreen examinations
                    and ePortfolios offer exciting opportunities for reliable, robust digital assessment of student achievement.

                <p>
                    Each subject group in each year of the MYP requires at least 50 hours of teaching time. To provide greater flexibility in meeting local requirements and individual student learning needs, students in years 4 and 5 have the option to take courses from six of the eight subject groups within certain limits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every year, MYP students participate in at least one collaboratively planned Interdisciplinary Unit (IDU) involving at least two subject groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students also complete a personal project in year 5 of the programme, which allows them to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they have gained throughout the programme.

                <p class="m-0">
                    The MYP teaching methodology has a student-centered approach; where the students are encouraged to learn through a variety of media. Students are introduced to the examination system wherein project-based learning will be heavily integrated into the curriculum and assessment framework.
