            The MYP is an intensive framework that empowers students aged 11 to 16 to make practical connections between their studies and the real world, preparing them for success in higher education and in life. Students who have successfully completed the MYP are well prepared to begin the IB Diploma Programme (DP).

            The IB MYP aims to assist students in developing their personal understanding, emerging sense of self, and community responsibility.

                    IB MYP students gain a better understanding of their common humanity and shared commitment of the planet by having to engage in developmentally appropriate explorations of:

                    <li>Relationships and identities            </li>
                    <li>Individual and cultural identity        </li>
                    <li>Orientations in space and time          </li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    A concept is a big idea — an enduring principle or conception whose significance transcends particular origins, subject matter, or time period. MYP students use concepts as a vehicle to investigate personal, local, and global issues and ideas, as well as to examine knowledge holistically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    IB MYP curriculum is built around key concepts. They originate in and are shared by academic disciplines. They bring together students' academic experiences and provide teachers with a common lexicon. These ideas foster a thinking culture that encourages students to see connections, contradictions, alternative perspectives, and new ways of thinking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, discipline-specific related concepts add depth and focus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These concepts allow the teachers and students go beyond studying facts to thinking about what those facts mean and why they are relevant.

                Approaches to learning (ATL) provide the foundation for independent learning and encourage students to apply their knowledge and skills in unfamiliar contexts across all MYP subject groups. Students learn how to learn by developing and applying these social, thinking, research, communication, and self-management skills.

                    Students take action when they apply what they learn in the classroom and beyond. IB students strive to be caring community members who demonstrate a commitment to service by making a positive difference in the lives of others and the environment.

                    Students in the MYP are exposed to a diverse curriculum in order to encourage and explore diverse options. The MYP curriculum provides an engaging and effective framework for learning, both within and across subject areas.

                <p>
                    Each subject group in each year of the MYP requires at least 50 hours of teaching time. To provide greater flexibility in meeting local requirements and individual student learning needs, students in years 4 and 5 have the option to take courses from six of the eight subject groups within certain limits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every year, MYP students participate in at least one collaboratively planned Interdisciplinary Unit (IDU) involving at least two subject groups.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students also complete a personal project in year 5 of the programme, which allows them to demonstrate the knowledge and skills they have gained throughout the programme.
                </p>
                <p class="m-0">
                    The MYP teaching methodology has a student-centered approach; where the students are encouraged to learn through a variety of media. Students are introduced to the examination system wherein project-based learning will be heavily integrated into the curriculum and assessment framework.
