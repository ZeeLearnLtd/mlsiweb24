                Through our well-established iCare Programme, we are committed to child safety and security. In fact, we have a zero-tolerance policy for anything that does not meet our standards for What is Right for the Child. We take pride in the fact that we have the most security guards in comparison to other schools. CCTV cameras are installed in classrooms to monitor student discipline and for safety. Security personnel are stationed on each floor.
