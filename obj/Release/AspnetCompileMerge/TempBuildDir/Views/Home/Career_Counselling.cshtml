            College and career counselling for students is an integral part of the IB Diploma Programme at Mount Litera School International.

            MLSI provides end-to-end career planning assistance. We help our students identify an area of interest, support them during the university application process and assist them with documentation. This includes uploading all documents and couriering services with the exception of visa applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Predominantly IB diploma students apply to overseas universities, however recently many IB diploma students are staying back in India to complete their first degree. We assist them in this case as well.

                    Choosing a career is one of the most important decisions you will make in life. It’s about so much more than deciding what you will do to make a living. To start with, think about the amount of time we spend at work. We are at work for approximately 71% of every year. Over our lifetimes, this comes to roughly 31.5 years out of the 45 years most of us spend working, from the beginning of our careers until retirement. The importance of selecting a career with which we are satisfied cannot be overemphasised.

                    One of the first steps towards College planning is to opt for the correct pre-requisite courses
                    while at school. The College counselling department assists both students and parents in
                    understanding the various requirements both in India and abroad for various career choices.
                    Parents need to take a prior appointment with the College Counsellor to discuss the subject
                    choices. Ideally parents and students start planning as early as in grade 8, however it is never
                    too late to get the correct subject choice counselling. The department also helps IB Diploma
                    students in identifying the Higher Level (HL) and Standard Level (SL) subjects.

                    Choice of colleges may depend on factors like student and parent preferences, career choice,
                    aspiration, priority, affordability, country, region and ranking. The department is always
                    willing to spare time to meet parents to discuss these issues in pre-arranged counselling
                    sessions. Since September to January of every academic year is a busy time with college
                    applications, we request parents to schedule counselling appointments during the lean period
                    from February to August.

                    Students fill a requisition form providing details of their academics, extracurricular, and their
                    field of interest. After studying the requisition form through mutual consultation, colleges
                    shortlisted are classified as, “Safe Universities”, “Reach Universities” and “Dream
                    Universities”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A dream university is a tertiary institute which takes students well above your standardized
                    scores (SAT or ACT), academic and overall credentials. There is a great possibility that you
                    may not be selected in these colleges. Students usually pick two dream universities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Reach university would have their average students below your standardized scores (SAT
                    or ACT), academic and overall credentials, hence there is a fair chance of you making it to
                    these institutions. Ideally two to three of these universities could be opted for.
                </p>
                <p class="m-0">
                    A safe university is one where you would definitely get admission as their top student’s
                    credentials are below your standardized scores (SAT or ACT), academic, and overall
                    credentials. Two or three of these universities are a safe option.

                    The College Counselling department helps students in preparing all required documents on
                    time, every time. As a huge volume of requisitions are being processed during the peak
                    period, the department would require ONE MONTH prior request by means of a completely
                    filled requisition form. For example: A student wanting to process a regular admission at
                    the end of December would submit the requisition form by the end of November. The date is
                    counted from the first submission of the application, in case a student applies during multiple
                    admission cycles. School provides the original copy of the transcripts (report card) after
                    every major summative assessment.

                <p>
                    All the university related documents are provided by the school. From attestation to giving
                    Predicted Grades are done through school only. We do not give any documents to the outside
                    agency or to the student. All the documents processed through school are sent directly to the
                    university by courier, uploaded on university portals or through email as required by the
                    University.
