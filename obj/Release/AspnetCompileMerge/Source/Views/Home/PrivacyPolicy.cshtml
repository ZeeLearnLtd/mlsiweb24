                <h5 class="header5">Cookies and other technologies</h5>
                <p>
                    A “cookie” is a small piece of information stored by a web server on a web browser so it can be later read back from that browser. Cookies are useful for enabling the browser to remember information specific to a given user. We place both permanent and temporary cookies in your computer’s hard drive. The cookies do not contain any of your personally identifiable information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ZLL use data collection devices such as “cookies” on certain pages of the Website to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, to improve our product and services, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. ZLL may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Website. When customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Cookies” are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a “cookie”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are “session cookies,” meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Website and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session.
