                    Conforming by the same norm, at Mount Litera School International, each classroom is in itself, a community, connected by a sense of purpose, in a climate that is communicative, disciplined, caring, with occasions for celebration.

                    The learning environment not only includes the physical campus, but the emotional climate that is conducive to a child’s learning.

Our highly experienced faculty creates this community so all students will get along and celebrate one another's differences.

                    Since the learning process is dynamic, teachers balance a traditional approach to skill and knowledge acquisition with an inquiry-based model that recognizes the importance of students constructing knowledge and “learning by doing.” To support this guiding principle, class sizes are kept small so that students have maximum opportunities to interact with their teachers and one another.

                    Mount Litera School International is dedicated to providing the time and resources needed for teachers to be professionally renewed.

                    Parent involvement in school life is very important. We know that a healthy, respectful partnership between home and school is a critical element of an education. The school takes seriously its role in providing parent education and encourages all parents to work within a collaborative, positive framework.

                    Teachers, administration, staff, parents, and students together ,are all in the process of acquiring new knowledge and skills every day. We work hard to nurture a learning environment in which ALL members of the school feel secure in taking risks, asking questions, and exploring new alternatives.
